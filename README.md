# Robotic-Arm-Diary
This Is Where my progress of my robotic arm project

"Quick Note that there were pictures but they were lost"

June 1: i had to make something interesting for my project, since most people are doing cars then i might as well do something different. i have to come up with an idea 

June 2: Just came up with an idea! what if i make a robotic arm i said to myself. i found this one video on youtube that shows a simple robotic arm that can move automatically.

June 3 - 4: basically i was browsing for the right kit to make my robotic arm this would surely do since making an arm was my passion.

June 5: i bought the materials and was coming up with a plan

June 6: when i came to school i was confident that i would get the arm itself assembled in only one day, i was basically wrong

June 7: I Got Stuck in placing the 3rd motor base, a single screw would not come in but i was calm and i tried to place it in and at the end it worked

June 8: This time i got stuck in the crane part because of a screw that did not fit so i ended up adding tape instead. it should hopefully hold it in place
 
June 9: spent the whole period working on it. i then got a brain idea, "i wonder if Aurdino code ( which is actually what the robotic arm is supposed to run on) is compatible with Microcontroller code". i was excited

June 10: to put it to the test i asked Mr Lam if that was possible and he said No so i was now stumped because that technically means i have to make the whole code from scratch

June 11  - 14: Spent four days on how to try and connect the servo motors to my ubmp4

June 15 - 16: i was in a sort of overthinking moment in this day because i was thinking about the code first before the basics and obviously i dont want to fail

June 17: It Is Getting Close so thats when i started panicking because i still could not figure out the code, thats when Cedric told me to understand how the servo works and that i should instead connect all the motors to each button so make it manual and not automatic. he basically saved me

June 18 - 19: started learniung about how the servo works and then i followed some internet tutorials

June 20: now i need to start the program itself since i have a deadline to meet and i only have a few days left

June 21: The Code is halfway complete, i programmed one servo to function now i just have to figure out the rest of them

June 22: The Code is finished so the robotic arm is done and is ready to be presented, i just have to modify the code itself
